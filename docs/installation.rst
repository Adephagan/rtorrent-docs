Installation Guide
==================

This chapter has some pointers to common ways of installing
*rTorrent* on your machine. It does not provide yet another way to do that,
because there already are plentiful and redundant sources for that out there.


Installation Using OS Packages
------------------------------

**TODO**

 * the `rTorrent wiki <https://github.com/rakshasa/rtorrent/wiki#packages>`_ lists package names and installation commands for a lot of *Linux* distributions and other operating systems.


Automated Installation

Installing from Source

rTorrent Distributions
----------------------

 * `rTorrent-PS <https://github.com/pyroscope/rtorrent-ps#rtorrent-ps>`_ is a *rTorrent* distribution (not a fork of it), in form of a set of patches that improve the user experience and stability of official *rTorrent* releases. The notable additions are the more condensed ncurses UI with colorization and a network bandwidth graph, and a default configuration providing many new features, based in part on an extended command set.
 * `rTorrent-PS-CH <https://github.com/chros73/rtorrent-ps_setup/wiki>`_ puts more patches and a different default configuration on top of *rTorrent-PS*. It also tries to work with the current git HEAD of *rTorrent*, which *rTorrent-PS* does not.
