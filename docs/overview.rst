Overview
========

The :doc:`installation` has some pointers to common ways of installing
rTorrent on your machine. It does not provide yet another way to do that,
because there already are plentiful and redundant sources out there.

To help you with basic configuration tasks, the :doc:`cookbook`
contains a quick start into the ‘scripting language’ rTorrent uses
for its configuration files.
It then goes on showing how to solve some common configuration use-cases.

Building on that, the :doc:`scripting` explains more complex commands and
constructs of said language. It also helps with controlling rTorrent
from the outside, via the XMLRPC protocol.

The :doc:`cmd-ref` chapter lists all relevant XMLRPC and ‘private’ commands
of *rTorrent* with a short explanation.
