Welcome to the “rTorrent Handbook”!
===================================

This is a comprehensive manual and user guide for the `rTorrent`_ bittorrent client,
written by and for the community.
See also the `homepage of the community project`_ and the `community wiki`_.

The :doc:`overview` chapter offers you a guided tour through this manual,
or browse through the table of contents below to find what you're looking for.

If you like what is here but are missing something,
the best way to fill that hole is to pour what you know into it.
Every contribution counts, and instead of lamenting the situation,
please go fix it by taking small steps in the right direction.
If everyone chimes in, we all profit in the end.

:doc:`contributing` tells you more about how to add your changes to the project.
